# Task-03
# Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Datase
This repository contains a project focused on implementing a Decision Tree Classifier using a bank marketing dataset. The dataset consists of customer information and is used to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on certain features.

# Files
Decision TreeClassifier.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier. It includes the necessary steps for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree structure.

bank-additional.csv: The dataset used for analysis and modeling. It contains various features such as age, job, marital status, education, default, balance, housing, loan status, and the outcome of previous marketing campaigns.

# Key Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Feature Selection: Selected relevant features for building the model.
Data Encoding: Categorical features were converted into numerical form using label encoding and one-hot encoding where necessary.
Splitting the Dataset: The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
2. Building the Decision Tree Classifier
Model Training: The Decision Tree Classifier was trained using the training dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Parameters such as tree depth, splitting criteria, and others were fine-tuned to optimize performance.
Visualization: Visualized the decision tree structure to understand how the model makes decisions.
3. Model Evaluation
Accuracy, Precision, and Recall: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was generated to visualize the model's classification performance on both true positives and false positives/negatives.
ROC Curve: Plotted the ROC curve to evaluate the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
4. Feature Importance
Determining Key Features: Analyzed feature importance to understand which factors contributed the most to the classification outcome.
# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating the Decision Tree model.
